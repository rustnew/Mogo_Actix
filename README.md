# 🦀 Rust Backend API with Actix-Web and MongoDB

This project is a backend REST API built with **Rust**, using the **Actix-web** framework and **MongoDB** as the database. It is designed to offer a robust, fast, and scalable foundation for modern web applications, especially suitable for data-intensive systems like mining operations, IoT dashboards, logistics platforms, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

The API provides endpoints for managing resources stored in a MongoDB database. It handles typical CRUD operations and is designed with scalability and performance in mind. The structure follows clean architecture principles, separating data access, business logic, and API layers.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Rust** — for performance and safety
- **Actix-web** — powerful and asynchronous web framework
- **MongoDB** — NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage
- **Serde** — for JSON serialization/deserialization
- **dotenv** — for environment variable management
- **tokio** — async runtime for handling concurrent tasks

## 📚 Features

- 🔒 Secure and modular architecture
- ⚡ Fast asynchronous endpoints
- 🧩 Clean MongoDB integration
- 📄 JSON-based REST API
- 🧪 Ready for unit and integration testing
- 🔁 Easily extensible for new entities (users, logs, analytics, etc.)
